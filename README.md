This project is designed to function as a level in a theoretical larger RPG/mystery game. 
The Player navigates a room, interacting with Items to gather information and find Clues to help solve a murder mystery.
In this level, there are three Items to interact with, and one Clue.
Can you find the Clue?

This commit has the room set up correctly, allows the Player to navigate the room (while not paying attention to Furniture yet), and 
interact with Items by turning them blue when the spacebar is pressed and the Player is close enough to an Item. Comments are now 
cleaned up Javadoc comments and obsolete code that had been commented out has been removed.
