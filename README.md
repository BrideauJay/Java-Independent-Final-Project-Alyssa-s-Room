This project is designed to function as a level in a theoretical larger RPG/mystery game. 
The Player navigates a room, interacting with Items to gather information and find Clues to help solve a murder mystery.
In this level, there are three Items to interact with, and one Clue.
Can you find the Clue?

This commit has all functionality intact. When program is run, the instructions for using the controls are displayed, blocking out the room itself initially. Pressing the X key allows user to dismiss the instructions and begin playing the game. The Player can move around inside the room using the arrow keys but cannot leave it, and cannot climb the furniture. Player can move close to the Furniture but can only overlap it when their 'feet' would still be on the floor in front of the object. When the Player is close enough to an Item and presses the space bar, they can get all the information for the Item they're close to, including the hint if the Item is a Clue. Pressing the X button will dismiss this alert.
